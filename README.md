This repository contains a simple Python function to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  It also demonstrates how to handle the potential `ZeroDivisionError` that can occur when the input list is empty. The `bug.py` file shows the original code with the error, and `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version.
